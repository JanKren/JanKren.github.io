	abstract = {This paper investigates dynamics of Taylor bubble in counter-current flows, leveraging large eddy simulations combined with the volume of fluid method. Utilizing the OpenFOAM framework, we have implemented a high-order Runge–Kutta time-integration scheme, along with a piecewise linear interface calculation method for precise geometric reconstruction of the bubble interface. We examine the performance of algebraic vs geometric capturing techniques in the context of Taylor bubble breakup, focusing specifically on the transitional flow regime with a liquid Reynolds number of 1400. Our results reveal that the geometric capturing technique offers superior accuracy, improving our understanding of the breakup process and providing valuable insight for multiphase flow simulations in various engineering fields. Our study also reveals the emergence of a secondary vortex in the turbulent wake region behind the Taylor bubble, a phenomenon most prominent at finer mesh resolutions. This vortex represents a novel discovery in counter-current Taylor bubble flows.},

The experiment and the simulation were performed in an identical cross-section geometry with step expansion rate 2.25 and the square shape of the outlet duct at the Reynolds number in an inlet part of the section 7100. The experiment was performed in transparent test section, 1.2 m long, with 20 × 45 mm2 cross-section upstream and 45 × 45 mm2 downstream, while a domain that was three times shorter was used in the DNS. A 2D-2C PIV system with a single high-speed camera and a pulse laser was used for a series of two-dimensional measurements of the velocity ﬁeld at several cross-sections from two different perspectives. Variables analyzed in the experiment are time-averaged ﬂuid velocities, velocity RMS ﬂuctuations and two components of the Reynolds stress tensor. The key novelty is the comparison of two very accurate approaches, PIV and DNS, in the same cross-section geometry. Comparison of the similarities, and especially the differences between the two approaches, elucidates uncertainties of both studies and answers the question on what kind of agreement is expected when two very accurate approaches are compared.},

	abstract = {Turbulent heat transfer in a square duct, where a finite section of a single duct boundary is heated with an infinitely thin foil, was analyzed with LES and DNS approaches. Both computations were performed with OpenFOAM code with passive scalar approximation, using second order accurate schemes. Results are obtained for the key velocity and temperature statistics in the duct, with an emphasis on the temperature profiles and temperature fluctuations at the foil boundary, which appear due to the imposed constant heat flux boundary condition at the foil. Comparison of DNS and standard LES-WALE model show 20\% higher foil temperatures and temperature fluctuations in LES results. These differences are explained with detailed analysis of the LES-WALE model near-wall behavior. It has been demonstrated that LES-WALE yields highly accurate results only when employed with a finely resolved mesh. However, the computational costs associated with such refinement may not be necessarily justified especially with respect to DNS.},

	abstract = {Na Odseku za reaktorsko tehniko Inštituta Jožef Stefan se postavlja nov eksperiment v Laboratoriju za termohidravliko večfaznih tokov (THELMA). Namen eksperimenta je študija temperaturnih fluktuacij na greti kovinski foliji, ki je hlajena s turbulentnim tokom. Načrtovanje eksperimenta temelji na numeričnih simulacijah, v katerih smo analizirali vpliv različnih aproksimacij na temperaturne fluktuacije na greti foliji. To delo opisuje rezultate simulacij. 
Tok in prenos toplote v novem eksperimentu smo napovedali s simulacijami z metodo velikih vrtincev (ang. Large Eddy Simulation) s pomočjo računalniškega programa OpenFOAM. Prevajanja toplote v foliji nismo modelirali. Folijo smo opisali z idealiziranim robnim pogojem konstantnega toplotnega toka. Simulacije so predpostavljale nestisljiv, polno razvit turbulentni tok Newtonske tekočine z Reynoldsovim številom 10000. V prvih simulacijah je bila dodana temperatura kot pasivni skalar, torej brez povratne zanke na enačbo za ohranitev gibalne količine. Drugi del simulacij pa je upošteval spreminjanje viskoznosti vode s temperaturo ter vzgonske sile. Določili smo ustrezno toplotno moč folije v eksperimentu ter moč, pri kateri je mogoče zanemariti vpliv temperature na materialne lastnosti vode.
Posebej nas je zanimala porazdelitev temperature na vroči foliji v turbulentnem režimu. Z analizo koherentnih termičnih struktur v simulacijah smo uspeli določiti potrebno resolucijo in frekvenco visokohitrostne termične kamere pri danemu Reynoldsovemu in Prandtlovemu številu. V zaključku je predstavljena kratka primerjava naših simulacij s preliminarnimi meritvami temperaturnih fluktuacij na greti foliji.},

	abstract = {The stagnant Taylor bubble in vertical isothermal turbulent counter-current flow was analyzed using 2D shadowgraphy experiments and two distinct high-fidelity numerical simulations. One simulation employed the geometrical VOF interface tracking method within the OpenFOAM code, while the other utilized the explicit front tracking method of the TrioCFD code. Interface recognition algorithms were applied to the photographs and compared with the results of 3D simulations performed with LES and pseudo-DNS accuracy in OpenFOAM and TrioCFD, respectively. The measured Taylor bubbles exhibited an asymmetric bullet-train shape and a specific speed, which were compared with the predictions of both numerical approaches. Reproducing the experiment proved challenging for both otherwise well-established methods frequently used in interface tracking simulations of two-phase flows. Grid resolution and subgrid turbulent models, known for their success in single-phase turbulence, were less accurate near the water–air interface. Additional experimental parameters compared with simulations were related to the dynamics of tiny disturbance waves with amplitudes ranging from 10 to 100 µm along the interface of the Taylor bubbles. The speed and spectra of the surface disturbance waves were reproduced numerically with moderate success despite detailed grid refinement in the relevant region of the computational domain.},

	url = {https://repozitorij.uni-lj.si/IzpisGradiva.php?id=161876},
	abstract = {This thesis presents an in-depth investigation of Taylor bubbles in counter-current flows, employing a dual approach of high-fidelity numerical simulations and state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Taylor bubble is one of the manifestations of two-phase slug flow in a pipe. It consists of large gas bubbles separated from each other by slugs of the liquid phase. The dynamics of Taylor bubbles in air-water mixture were examined in two different regimes - the transitional flow regime with Reynolds number \$Re = 1400\$ and the fully turbulent flow with \$Re = 5600\$. The study focused on bubbles of various lengths in stagnant conditions, where buoyancy is counterbalanced by inertial drag in the downward turbulent flow.

The experimental study focuses on three main aspects: the analysis of bubble disintegration, the detailed analysis of the bubble interface dynamics and measurement of velocity fields using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique. By developing specialized algorithms for interface reconstruction from the obtained high-speed camera images, the research identified asymmetric, bullet-train-like shapes of Taylor bubbles in fully turbulent flow, but axi-symmetric bubbles in transitional liquid flow. This was a significant finding, demonstrating also the presence of disturbance waves along the bubble interface, which were tracked with high sensitivity. These waves exhibited correlated movements across the bubble surface, adding new understanding to the behavior of such flows.

The numerical study focused on the bubble behavior and breakup mechanisms, highlighting the limitations of the numerical methods. Using the OpenFOAM framework, the research implemented a high-order Runge-Kutta time-integration scheme combined with the Volume-Of-Fluid (VOF) method and the geometric reconstruction of bubble interfaces. The study concentrated on the transitional flow regime with a liquid \$Re=1400\$, comparing algebraic and geometric capturing techniques. The results highlighted the superiority of geometric reconstruction in capturing the nuances of Taylor bubble breakup. A novel discovery was also the emergence of a secondary vortex in the turbulent wake of the Taylor bubble, particularly noticeable at finer mesh resolutions.

This thesis contributes to the field of nuclear engineering and fluid dynamics by providing a more comprehensive understanding of Taylor bubble behavior in counter-current flows. The combination of experimental observations and numerical simulations offers a holistic view, paving the way for improved designs and operations in various engineering fields where such flow phenomena are encountered.},
